    /// - `mode`: The mode argument specifies the file mode bits to be applied when
    /// a new file is created.  If neither O_CREAT nor O_TMPFILE is specified in flags,
    /// then mode is ignored (and can thus be specified as 0, or simply omitted). The
    /// mode argument must be supplied if O_CREAT or O_TMPFILE is specified in flags;
    /// if it is not supplied, some arbitrary bytes from the stack will be applied as
    /// the file mode. The effective mode is modified by the process's umask in the usual way:
    /// in the absence of a default ACL, the mode of the created file is (mode & ~umask).
    ///
    /// # Error
    /// - `EBADF`: pathname is relative but dirfd is neither [`AT_FDCWD`] nor a valid file descriptor.

    /// nor O_RDWR was specified. O_CREAT was specified in flags and the final component  ("basename")
    /// of the new file's pathname is invalid (e.g., it contains characters not permitted by the
    /// underlying filesystem).
    /// - `EISDIR`: pathname refers to a directory and the access requested involved writing (that is,
    /// O_WRONLY or O_RDWR is set).
    /// - `ENOENT`: O_CREAT is not set and the named file does not exist. A directory component
    /// in pathname does not exist or is a dangling symbolic link.
    /// - `ENOTDIR`: A component used as a directory in pathname is not, in fact, a directory,
